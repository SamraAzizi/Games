# 2048 Game in Python

Welcome to 2048! This is a Python implementation of the classic 2048 game, where the objective is to reach the 2048 tile by combining tiles with the same number. Use the arrow keys to move the tiles left, right, up, or down. Tiles with the same number will merge when they collide. After each move, a new tile will randomly appear on the grid with a value of either 2 or 4. Keep combining tiles and strategize your moves to reach the 2048 tile and win the game!

## How to Play
- Use the arrow keys (Left, Right, Up, Down) to move the tiles on the grid.
- Tiles with the same number will merge when they collide, forming a new tile with the sum of their values.
- After each move, a new tile will appear randomly on the grid with a value of either 2 or 4.

## Getting Started
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the Python script (`2048_game.py`).
4. Run the script using the command `python 2048_game.py`.


## Controls
- Use the arrow keys (Left, Right, Up, Down) to move the tiles on the grid.

## Customization
- You can customize the appearance of the game by modifying the `COLORS` dictionary in the Python script.
- Additionally, you can adjust the game size by changing the `game_size` variable in the `Game` class constructor.
