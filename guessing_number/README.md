# Guess Number Game

## Overview

The "Guess Number" game is a simple Python program where the computer selects a random number within a specified range, and the player tries to guess that number. The computer provides hints (whether the guessed number is higher or lower than the secret number) until the player guesses the correct number.

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script `guess_number.py`.
2. The computer will welcome you and state that it's thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
3. You input your guess.
4. The computer will inform you if your guess is too low or too high, giving you hints to narrow down your guesses.
5. Keep guessing until you correctly guess the number.
6. After guessing correctly, the computer will display the number of attempts it took you to guess the correct number.
7. You can choose to play again or exit the game.

## Implementation

The game is implemented in Python and utilizes the `random` module to generate a random number within the specified range. It consists of a single function `guess_the_number()` that contains the game logic.

## Running the Game

To play the game, simply run the `guess_the_number()` function within the Python environment.
