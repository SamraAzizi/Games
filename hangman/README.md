# Hangman

Hangman is a classic word guessing game where players try to guess a word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. The game provides a fun way to challenge your vocabulary and deduction skills.

## How to Play

1. **Getting Started**: Run the provided Python script (`hangman.py`) to start the game.

2. **Word Selection**: A word is randomly chosen from a predefined list of words. Each letter of the word is represented by a dash ("_").

3. **Guessing Letters**: The player guesses letters one at a time by typing them into the console.

4. **Correct Guesses**: If the guessed letter is present in the chosen word, it will be revealed in its correct positions within the word.

5. **Incorrect Guesses**: If the guessed letter is not in the word, a part of the hangman is drawn. The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the word correctly.

6. **Winning the Game**: The player wins by correctly guessing all the letters in the word before running out of attempts.

7. **Play Again**: After winning or losing, the player has the option to play again by typing "yes" or "no" in the console.
