# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Python.

## How to Play

1. **Objective:** The goal is to be the first player to get three of their symbols (X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal.
2. **Players:** Two players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols.
3. **Winning Conditions:** The game ends when one player achieves three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.
4. **Draw:** If all spaces on the board are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

## Setup

1. **Run the Game:** Execute the `tic_tac_toe.py` file using Python:
    ```
    python tic_tac_toe.py
    ```

## How to Play

1. **Instructions:** Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the row and column where you want to place your symbol.
2. **Input Format:** Enter the row and column numbers separated by a space (e.g., `1 2` for row 1, column 2).
3. **Validation:** The game will prevent players from placing their symbols in already occupied spaces.
## Customization

- You can modify the symbols used for the players by changing the `"X"` and `"O"` strings in the `players` list.
- Enjoy playing
